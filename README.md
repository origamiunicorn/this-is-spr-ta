# One Good Knight
**One Good Knight** is a text-based choose your own adventure game. Utilizing a MySQL databse, users can sign up for the site, then create one or more knight characters to play through the game with. By selecting from one or more choices provided on each story page, users will find their way to one of five endings, with varying degrees of success or failure in achieving their objective along the way.

This is all part of This Is SPR-ta's Project Two for UCLA's Fullstack Web Development Coding Bootcamp (September 2019 to March 2020). 

## How It Works
**One Good Knight** requires a login to play, thus when the site is visited, the index page is rendered and presented until a user signs up for an account. Presently, the user's account stores their username, password, email address, and any associated game information tied to their account.
